This repo contains code to run the The Baby Sleep Coach. The Baby Sleep Coach provides sleep analysis of your baby, using only a video feed. You can access the sleep analysis via a locally hosted web app, which runs on launch.

## Pre-requisites

- Docker
- Camera which supports RTSP
- Compute accessible via HTTP requests (I used a Raspberry Pi, but you can use any computer)

## tl;dr Run it with Docker

Copy the .env_sample template into .env

```cp example.env .env```

### Configure .env file:

`CAM_URL` URL of your camera. Likely `rtsp://admin:password@192.168.CAMERA_IP:554/h264Preview_01_sub` or `/dev/video0` for a webcam

`PORT` Port for accessing web app

`REACT_APP_BACKEND_IP` IP of your backend/api layer. Likely 192.168.COMPUTER_IP:8001

`REACT_APP_RESOURCE_SERVER_IP` IP of your resource server (runs on launch) Likely 192.168.COMPUTER_IP:8000

`HATCH_IP` (optional) IP of your hatch for wake light

`VIDEO_PATH` (optional) use to set path to recorded footage for debugging

### Update docker-compose

Update the path in `docker-compose.yml` to be the root of this project on your machine.

### Run it
`docker compose up`
